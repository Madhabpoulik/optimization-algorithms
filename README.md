# Optimization Algorithms
This repository contains some optimization algorithms in Python, namely **Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm**, **Differential Evolution**, **Self Adaptive Differential Evolution** and **Differential Evolution with Composite Trial Vector Generation Strategies and Control Parameters**. All algorithms generates **logs** and **statitical results**, as well as **convegence and diversity graphs** for each run and overall runs, which is defined by the user.
